# Always follow those rules for every response

1. Always think about security. Alway assume you need to make it secure instantly.
2. Always think about the SEO. it needs to be good and perfect.
4. Don't throw everything in one file. If you know this will need types, create a type file or use existing. Or also as an Example:
If we suddenly need cookies: Think about a CookieService. What i mean is: Code efficiently.
5. Always use --legacy-peer-deps when working with nextjs.
